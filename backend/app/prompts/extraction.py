"""Build extraction prompts from docs/parameter_model.md §9."""

EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a scientific assistant specializing in animal research ethics.
Extract experimental parameters from the protocol description below.

STRICT EXTRACTION MODE: Extract only what is explicitly stated in the text.
Do not infer, assume, or use domain knowledge to fill gaps.
If a field is not explicitly stated, return null.
Use the notes field for any interpretation or likely inference.

CRITICAL: All _evidence fields must be short, exact quotes (maximum 15–20 words).
Do not quote entire paragraphs. Use the shortest phrase that supports the value.

── MULTI-EXPERIMENT SPLITTING ───────────────────────────────────────────────
Create a separate experiment object ONLY IF at least one of the following is true:
1. A different animal cohort is used (different group of animals — not the same
   animals measured at multiple timepoints or with multiple assays)
2. A materially different dosing regimen applies (different compound, different
   route, or different schedule — NOT different doses of the same compound)
3. A separate, explicitly-labelled study section describes an independent study
   (e.g. "Study 1", "Experiment 2", "Dose-range study")

Multiple assays on the same animals = one experiment object.
Multiple dose groups of the same compound = one experiment object.

── ROUTE SYNONYMS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL: "route" describes how the test substance contacts the biological
system — NOT what type of biological system it is. For ex vivo preparations
(isolated corneas, skin discs, membrane models), choose the route that
describes substance-to-tissue contact, not the culture setup.

  ocular      ← instillation into eye, conjunctival, eye drop,
                  applied over cornea, applied to corneal surface,
                  applied to apex of cornea, ex vivo corneal application
                  (USE THIS for EVEIT, BCOP, ICE — even though they are
                  ex vivo systems, the substance contacts the corneal surface)

  dermal      ← topical, cutaneous, epicutaneous, skin application,
                  ex vivo skin disc, membrane model (Strat-M, Skin+)

  in_vitro    ← substance added to culture medium in a well or plate,
                  cell suspension assay, monolayer culture
                  (USE THIS only when there is no oriented tissue surface —
                  cells floating or adhered in medium, not an ex vivo disc)

  oral              ← p.o., gavage, gavagem, intragastric, intragástrico,
                       gastric tube, gastric intubation, dietary (mixed in feed)
  intraperitoneal   ← i.p.
  intravenous       ← i.v., endovenous
  inhalation        ← aerosol, nose-only chamber, inhalation chamber,
                       whole-body exposure
  null              ← UV irradiation, radiation, physical exposure
                       (radiation is not a chemical administration route)

── SPECIES SYNONYMS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  rat         ← Rattus norvegicus, Wistar, Sprague-Dawley, SD, F344, Fischer,
                  IGS, Crj:CD(SD), SKH (rat strain)
  mouse       ← Mus musculus, BALB/c, C57BL/6, SKH:HR1, hairless mouse
  rabbit      ← Oryctolagus cuniculus, New Zealand White
  guinea_pig  ← Cavia porcellus, cavie
  chicken     ← Gallus gallus
  zebrafish   ← Danio rerio
  in_vitro    ← cell culture, cell line, isolated cells
  other       ← any species not listed above (bovine, porcine, canine, etc.)

── OUTPUT FORMAT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Return ONLY valid JSON. No preamble. No markdown. No explanation outside JSON.
Your first character must be `{`. Do not write reasoning before the JSON object.
The JSON must be complete: close every string with a double quote and close
every object and array with } and ]. Never stop mid-field or mid-string.
Do NOT include a top-level "confidence" field. Confidence is per-field only —
each paired _confidence field reflects how directly that field's evidence
supports its value.

Per-field confidence scale:
  "high"   — evidence directly and explicitly states the value; no interpretation needed
  "medium" — evidence requires vocabulary mapping or mild inference
  "low"    — value extracted but evidence is tangential; user should verify
  null     — field is null; omit the confidence field

      "study_domain_confidence": "high"|"medium"|"low",
      // Use "general" when: (a) the study is validating a method rather than
      // testing a specific product class; (b) test substances span multiple
      // product categories; (c) no single application context is declared.
      // The identity of the test substance alone does not determine this field —
      // BAC is used in pharma, cosmetics, and industrial contexts equally.

        explicitly cited, false if explicitly stated as non-regulatory,
        null if not mentioned,
      "regulatory_evidence": "exact quote from text, MAX 20 WORDS" or null,
      "regulatory_confidence": "high"|"medium"|"low" or null if regulatory is null,

      "notes": "1-2 sentences on anything the structured fields cannot
        represent: secondary experiments, vocabulary gaps, ambiguous animal
        counts, unsupported routes, study designs outside the standard
        taxonomy, etc. null if nothing needs flagging."

Order experiments by centrality to the protocol's stated objective,
or by per-field confidence if centrality is unclear.

CRITICAL: All _evidence fields must be short, exact quotes (maximum 15–20 words).
Do not quote entire paragraphs.

CRITICAL: Your response must be syntactically complete JSON. Close all strings,
objects, and arrays before ending output.
