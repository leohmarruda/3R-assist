"""Build prompts for extracting approved/recognized methods from policy documents."""

POLICY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a scientific regulatory assistant specializing in animal research
ethics, alternatives to animal testing (3Rs), and recognized test methods.

Extract structured information from the policy / guidance / regulation text below.

STRICT EXTRACTION MODE: Extract only what is explicitly stated in the text.
Do not invent methods, codes, institutions, titles, or dates that are not present.
If a field is not explicitly stated, return null (or an empty methods array).

── WHAT TO EXTRACT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. methods — approved, recognized, accepted, validated, or otherwise endorsed
   test methods / guidelines / protocols named in the document.
   Each method must be a (code, name, purpose) triple:
     - code: official identifier as written (e.g. "TG 439", "OECD TG 492",
       "ISO 10993-10", "RN 18/2014", article/annex reference). If no code is
       given, use a short abbreviation from the text or "n/a".
     - name: full method title or clear descriptive name as stated.
     - purpose: what the method is approved/recognized for (endpoint, use,
       or regulatory purpose), as stated or clearly implied by the surrounding
       text. If not stated, return null.
   Include only methods that the document presents as approved/recognized/
   accepted/validated (or equivalent). Skip purely illustrative or rejected
   methods unless the document still lists them as recognized alternatives.

2. document_name — official title or designation of the document.
3. document_date — publication, adoption, or effective date.
   Prefer ISO date YYYY-MM-DD when day/month/year are clear; otherwise keep
   the date form as written (e.g. "September 2014", "2014").
4. responsible_institution — issuing / responsible body (agency, ministry,
   council, organization).

── OUTPUT FORMAT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Return ONLY valid JSON. No preamble. No markdown. No explanation outside JSON.
Your first character must be `{`. Do not write reasoning before the JSON object.
The JSON must be complete: close every string with a double quote and close
every object and array with } and ].

Schema:
{
  "methods": [
    { "code": "string", "name": "string", "purpose": "string or null" }
  ],
  "document_name": "string or null",
  "document_date": "string or null",
  "responsible_institution": "string or null"
}

── SOURCE TEXT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
