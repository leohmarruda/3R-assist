    "Materials and methods. 2.1. Materials: D-allulose (purity, >98%) was provided by "
    "Samyang Corporation. 2.2. Animals: SD rats (100 females, 60 males) were housed at "
    "22.5–24.5 °C and 53.2–62.8% relative humidity. Quarantined for 8 days. Mating (1:1) "
    "occurred for 5 days. Presence of vaginal plug or sperm defined gestation day 0 (GD0). "
    "All rat maintenance was approved by the Ningbo Institutional Animal Care and Use "
    "Committee, following OECD guidelines 414. 2.3. Study design and parameters: Rats received "
    "either 1250, 2500, 5000 mg/kg bw D-allulose or distilled water on GD6–15 via "
    "intragastric administration (10 mL per kg body weight). Animals observed daily for "
    "mortality, behavioral changes. Weighed once every 3 days. On GD 20, pregnant rats were "
    "weighed, anesthetized, and laparotomized to remove the uteri. Evaluation during caesarean "
    "section was conducted blindly. Endpoints: corpora lutea number, implantation number, "
    "live/dead fetuses, resorption rate. For live fetuses: sex ratio, body weight, body length, "
    "tail length, malformation rates (external, visceral, skeletal). Fetuses fixed in Bouin's "
    "solution (visceral) or 95% ethanol (skeletal). 2.4. Statistical analysis: Data given as "
    "mean ± SD. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U test used for non-parametric data; "
    "one-way ANOVA for parametric data. Significance set at p < 0.05."
